/**
 * Reads the 1C:Enterprise SYNTAX HELPER (the platform's own documentation) for a type and its
 * members. Issue #299.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists: the {@code mcore} model a platform type is built from carries names,
 * parameter lists and flags, but NOT the prose - and not even the return value of every method
 * ({@code Chart.GetValue} is documented as returning "the chart value at the given point and
 * series", which the model renders as a bare type). Everything this class adds - what a method
 * returns, and the DESCRIPTION of a type, method or property - exists only in the syntax helper.
 *
 * <p>It adds nothing where the helper itself has nothing: {@code AccessToken.Sign}, the case the
 * report cited, is documented as a PROCEDURE with no return section at all, so no return is
 * rendered for it. Neither source knows one, and none is invented.
 *
 * <p><b>How it reaches the helper, and why that is best-effort.</b> {@link PlatformDocProvider} is a
 * published class, but nothing publishes an INSTANCE: it is not an OSGi service, its constructor
 * takes internal loaders, and the Guice injector that binds it lives in a package EDT does not
 * export ({@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.bsl.ui.internal}). So the injector is reached REFLECTIVELY and
 * everything after that is normal typed code. Every failure - a renamed activator, a missing
 * binding, a headless workbench with no UI plugin started - is swallowed and simply yields "no
 * documentation": the caller then renders exactly what it rendered before. This must never turn a
 * working doc lookup into an error.
