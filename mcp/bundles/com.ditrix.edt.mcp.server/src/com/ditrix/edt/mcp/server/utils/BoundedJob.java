/**
 * Runs a unit of platform work in a background {@link Job} and waits for it with a hard
 * deadline, so an unattended MCP call can never be held open indefinitely by a wedged
 * platform operation.
 *
 * <p>Two layers of protection, deliberately combined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the work receives the {@link Job}'s own {@link IProgressMonitor}, which is cancelled
 * when the deadline elapses — a platform call that polls its monitor (notably one waiting
 * for a conflicting scheduling rule) unwinds with {@code OperationCanceledException};</li>
 * <li>the caller stops waiting at the deadline regardless — cancellation is cooperative and
 * cannot preempt code that never polls, so the bound on the CALLER is what actually
 * guarantees an answer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>A timed-out job usually keeps running.</b> Cancelling only asks it to stop; the caller
 * must report the timeout honestly rather than pretend the work was undone. The one exception is
 * a job the deadline caught while it was still QUEUED: cancelling it there stops it from ever
 * starting, and reporting THAT as "it may still be running" is the opposite of the truth — hence
 * the separate {@link Outcome#TIMED_OUT_BEFORE_START}.
 *
 * <p>The job is joined synchronously by the calling thread, so an unattended-safety
 * suppressor armed around the call (auth dialogs, launch auto-confirm) still sees the
 * request in flight and keeps covering modals raised from the job thread.
