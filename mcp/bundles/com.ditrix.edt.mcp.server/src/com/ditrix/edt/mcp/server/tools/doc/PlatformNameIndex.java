/**
 * The names a platform lookup scanned, and the "not found" banner built from them.
 *
 * <p>It exists because the old banner listed the FIRST 30 names the provider happened to hand out
 * and called them "Available types" - and on a metadata-aware platform those first 30 are exactly
 * the names the lookup could not resolve. An answer that says "Type not found: CatalogObject" and
 * then lists {@code CatalogObject} among the available types sends a caller round a loop of
 * equivalent retries (issue #355). So a name earns its place twice: it is only COLLECTED if the
 * lookup would resolve it, and only PRINTED if it still passes {@link #resolvable} - a real
 * resolution attempt, affordable because it runs on the few dozen names about to be shown rather
 * than on the whole vocabulary. The index also counts everything it saw (a bare "first 30 ... more
 * available" hid the scale) and puts the names CLOSE to what was asked first - a miss is far more
 * often a spelling than a wrong concept.
 *
 * <p>Fed while the single scan over the provider's descriptions runs, so the banner costs no second
 * pass. Pure string logic with no platform dependency, hence unit-testable.
