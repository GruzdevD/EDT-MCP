/**
 * git's COMMON directory - where a linked worktree keeps everything that is shared with the
 * repository it was added to, and where JGit 6.8 never looks.
 * <p>
 * {@code git worktree add} gives the new worktree a git directory of its own,
 * {@code .git/worktrees/<name>}, holding only what is per-worktree ({@code HEAD}, {@code index},
 * {@code config.worktree}). Everything else - the configuration, the object store, the refs, and
 * git's legacy {@code remotes/} and {@code branches/} files - stays in the repository's original
 * {@code .git}, and the worktree finds it through a {@code commondir} file. Measured on git 2.35.1
 * from inside such a worktree:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code git rev-parse --git-path config} / {@code remotes} / {@code branches} all resolve into
 * the COMMON directory, and {@code git remote get-url <name>} prints what stands in a legacy file
 * there, credential and all;</li>
 * <li>the same files placed in the worktree's OWN git directory are IGNORED - {@code git remote
 * get-url} answers {@code No such remote} - which is why anything read through here must be read
 * from {@link #directory()} and from nowhere else. Reading both would refuse a repository over a
 * file git never looks at;</li>
 * <li>{@code config.worktree} is the exception that proves it: {@code --git-path} keeps that one in
 * the worktree's own directory, and the remote it declares is visible from the linked worktree and
 * NOT from the main one.</li>
 * </ul>
 * JGit 6.8 has no notion of any of this: {@code commondir} occurs nowhere in its sources, and
 * {@code FileRepository} reads its configuration from {@code getDirectory()/config} - a file that
 * does not exist in a linked worktree - so such a repository reports no format version and no
 * remotes whatsoever. Hence this class.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it does NOT do.</b> It answers where the shared directory is, and nothing else. It does
 * not decide whether what it points at is a repository (see {@link #of}), and it does not read the
 * {@code GIT_COMMON_DIR} environment variable - deliberately: that variable is stripped from the
 * environment of every git process this plug-in starts, so a value inherited from the IDE's own
 * environment would make this class and the git it is guarding disagree about which repository they
 * are talking about.

     * SPACE was measured to stay part of the path - {@code ../.. } made git answer
     * {@code fatal: not a git repository}. Swallowing it here would resolve a directory git cannot.
     * (What the operating system then does with the byte is its own business, and Windows differs:
     * its path layer drops a trailing space from a component, so such a pointer resolves there
     * whatever this class does. Harmless in the direction it goes - git refuses to run at all, so
     * there is no output for the check to have missed - and the reason the test for this pins a
     * TAB, which nothing but {@code trim} would remove.)</li>
     * <li><b>Zero bytes is fatal</b>, and it is the ONLY empty-ish shape that is - content that
     * STRIPS to nothing is explicitly accepted below and must not be read back into this list.
     * ({@code fatal: failed to read .../commondir}.) git resolves the empty
     * remainder against the git directory, lands on the git directory itself, and reads the
     * configuration there - so this returns that directory rather than refusing.
     * <p>
     * The difference took three attempts to establish, and the middle one is worth keeping as a
     * warning. A probe appeared to show git failing on a lone terminator too - but its worktree's
     * admin directory was not repository-like, so the resolved directory was unusable for a reason
     * that had nothing to do with terminators. A fixture that cannot produce the positive outcome
     * cannot be evidence against it. With {@code objects/}, {@code refs/} and a {@code config} in
     * place, git answers 0 and prints the remote from that config.</li>
     * <li><b>A relative path is resolved against the git directory</b>, an absolute one is used as
     * it stands - git's rule.</li>
     * <li><b>Canonicalized</b>, as git canonicalizes it - {@code get_common_dir_noenv} ends in

     * only opened underneath the directory and the operating system resolves {@code ..} anyway.
     * That reasoning missed relative {@code [include]} directives: JGit resolves one against the
     * LEXICAL parent of the config file it came from, so handing back an uncanonical spelling makes
     * the pre-flight read a different file than the git process it guards - and the whole point of
     * this check is that those two read the same thing. Canonicalizing costs a failure mode
     * ({@link Fault#NOT_A_DIRECTORY} when the target is not there, {@link Fault#TARGET_UNREADABLE}
     * when it cannot be examined) and buys agreement with git.</li>
     * <li><b>The target must be a directory.</b> git answers {@code fatal: not a git repository}
     * when it is not.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <b>Fails CLOSED past the existence test</b>, in two kinds of case that are worth keeping
     * apart rather than blurring into one comfortable claim:
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>the pointer is unusable as a pointer</b> - ZERO BYTES, naming something that is
     * not a directory, or unreadable. NOT content that merely strips to nothing: that is accepted
     * and resolves to the git directory, and reading it back into this list would restore the false
     * refusal it took three measurements to remove;</li>
     * <li><b>this code will not follow it</b> - it cannot be decoded, it is larger than this code
     * reads, it is not a regular file, or it is a Windows spelling whose root this code cannot
     * reproduce. Each buys something the alternative cannot: inspecting a DIFFERENT directory,
     * reading unbounded untrusted content, or blocking for ever on a named pipe are all worse than
     * declining.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The two groups are about the POINTER and about THIS CODE. Neither is about git: which of
     * these git survives was measured to depend on the platform (see the class javadoc), so it is
     * not a division this enumeration can make.
     * What it does NOT do is
     * judge whether the target is a REPOSITORY. An existing directory that is not one is accepted
     * here, and whatever {@code config} / {@code remotes} / {@code branches} happen to sit in it are
     * read; git cannot run there at all, so it prints nothing and there is nothing to leak, and
     * inventing a repository-shaped predicate is how a check starts refusing healthy files.
     * <p>
     * The bytes are decoded as UTF-8 STRICTLY - a malformed byte is an error, not a
     * {@code U+FFFD}. git takes a path as raw bytes, so a pointer this JVM cannot decode is one
     * where the two of us would disagree about which directory is meant, and the lenient decoding
     * would hand back a real, different path: if that one happens to exist and be clean, the check
     * approves a repository it never opened. So it is refused instead. {@code git worktree add}
