 * <em>never</em> throws to its caller — recording history must never perturb the
 * request that is being served. Memory is bounded by the cached buffer size times
 * a per-record payload cap: each payload string is truncated (with a trailing
 * {@link #TRUNCATION_MARKER}) <em>before</em> a short append critical section, so
 * the lock is held only for the O(1) deque eviction + add. {@link #snapshot}
 * returns a defensive copy, and history listeners are stored in a
 * {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} and fired outside the buffer lock with each callback
 * guarded so a faulty listener cannot break recording.</p>
 *
 * <p>The recording flag and buffer size are cached fields, refreshed only when
 * preferences change (via {@link #setRecordingEnabled} / {@link #setBufferSize});
 * {@code record} never reads the preference store, keeping the hot path allocation-
