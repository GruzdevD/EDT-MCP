/**
 * How a configuration-to-infobase update must treat infobase configuration changes made
 * OUTSIDE EDT (Designer, {@code ibcmd}, {@code 1cv8 DESIGNER /LoadConfigFromFiles}, a CLI
 * pipeline).
 *
 * <p>EDT detects such changes when it updates the infobase and — in an interactive session —
 * raises its blocking <em>"Infobase configuration changes"</em> modal offering
 * <b>Import</b> / <b>Override</b> / <b>Cancel</b>. Nothing presses that modal in an
 * unattended MCP run, so the update call blocks on the UI thread until the tool times out:
 * no launch, no report, no client. This policy is the unattended answer to that question,
 * selected per call by the {@code externalInfobaseChanges} tool parameter.
 *
 * <p>The three choices are NOT interchangeable — each writes something different:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #OVERRIDE} writes the INFOBASE (the project wins) — the literal meaning of
 *       "update the infobase from the project", and the default;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #IMPORT} writes the PROJECT sources (the infobase wins) — never the default,
 *       because it mutates the caller's working tree behind their back;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CANCEL} writes nothing and fails the call with an actionable error.</li>
 * </ul>
