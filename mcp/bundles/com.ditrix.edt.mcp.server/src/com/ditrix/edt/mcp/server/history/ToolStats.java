/**
 * One immutable per-tool row of the MCP context-usage statistics.
 *
 * <p>A row aggregates every recorded call that maps to the same key: for a
 * {@code tools/call} message the key is the tool name; every other JSON-RPC method
 * (initialize / tools/list / notifications / ping / ...) is keyed by its own method
 * name, so each gets its own row (see {@link StatsAggregator#keyOf}). Only a record
 * with no method at all falls back to the synthetic
 * {@link StatsAggregator#NON_TOOL_METHODS_KEY} bucket.
 *
 * <p>The headline metric is the <b>context weight</b> &mdash; a heuristic ranking
 * of how much of the LLM context a tool tends to fill. It is defined as the
 * (pre-truncation) response character total plus the approximate token count
 * ({@code responseChars / 4}). Token counts are <i>approximate</i> and are always
 * rendered with a tilde prefix ({@link StatsAggregator#APPROX_PREFIX}); they must
 * never be presented as exact. Response word count is exposed as its own displayed
 * statistic but is deliberately NOT part of the ranking metric, so ordering depends
 * only on size and is not perturbed by whitespace or language.
 *
 * <p>Instances are produced only by {@link StatsAggregator}; the class is a
 * side-effect-free value holder.
