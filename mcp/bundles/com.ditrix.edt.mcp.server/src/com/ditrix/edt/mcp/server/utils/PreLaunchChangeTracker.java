/**
 * Decides whether an EDT project still matches the content state of its last
 * successful pre-launch preparation, i.e. whether the expensive forced
 * derived-data recompute has to run again before the next launch.
 *
 * <p>Drives the selective recompute in
 * {@link LaunchLifecycleUtils#recomputeAndSettleIfDirty}: only projects whose
 * workspace content actually changed need a forced {@code recomputeAll()}; the
 * rest still get the cheap {@link BuildUtils#waitForDerivedData} pass to guard
 * against any background-derived-data work already in flight.
 *
 * <h3>Two signals, one of which outlives the plugin</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Content fingerprint (persistent).</strong> A short token derived
 *       from the paths and workspace modification stamps of every non-derived
 *       file in the project. The fingerprint of the content that was prepared is
 *       written to the project as a {@linkplain IResource#setPersistentProperty
 *       persistent property}, so it survives an EDT restart, a workspace reload
 *       and a project close/open. A project whose current fingerprint equals the
 *       stored one has already been prepared at exactly this content — nothing to
 *       recompute. A project with no stored fingerprint (never prepared, or a
 *       preparation that did not complete) is dirty.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Workspace listener (session-scoped).</strong> A {@code POST_CHANGE}
 *       listener stamps a generation counter on every qualifying file change, which
 *       keeps a project dirty when a change lands <em>during</em> the recompute —
 *       a window the fingerprint alone cannot describe, because that fingerprint is
 *       taken before the recompute starts.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Because the fingerprint is read from the workspace's own tree, that tree is
 * synced with the file system once per project per session before any stored
 * fingerprint is believed - see {@link #ensureTreeReflectsDisk}. Without it, sources
 * changed while EDT was not running would be certified by stale timestamps.
 *
 * <p>The listener is installed lazily on the first {@link #snapshot} call and lives
 * for the rest of the plugin lifetime (never removed — Eclipse will tear it down on
 * shutdown). Installation is idempotent and thread-safe.
 *
 * <h3>Why the fingerprint, and not "prepared during this session"</h3>
 * <p>The gate used to treat every project that had not been prepared <em>by this
 * plugin instance</em> as dirty. That made the signal a restart of the plugin, not
 * a change of the sources: the very first launch after EDT started always paid a
 * full {@code recomputeAll()} over the whole configuration even when the infobase
 * was demonstrably in sync. Restarting EDT says nothing about whether anybody
 * edited the sources; the fingerprint does, and it says it across restarts.
 *
 * <h3>Ordering-race handling (generation counters)</h3>
 * <p>The session-scoped dirty state is stored as a
 * {@code ConcurrentHashMap<String, Long>} mapping project name to the generation
 * number at the time of the last change. A global {@link AtomicLong} counter is
 * incremented on every qualifying file change. The conditional remove in
 * {@link #markPrepared(Collection, PrepareSnapshot)} uses
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap#remove(Object, Object)} — which removes the entry ONLY
 * when the stored generation still equals the snapshot value — so a change that
 * arrives DURING a recompute keeps the project dirty after {@code markPrepared}
 * returns instead of being silently discarded. In that case the stored fingerprint
 * is <em>erased</em> as well, so the unfinished state cannot be certified by a
 * later session either.
