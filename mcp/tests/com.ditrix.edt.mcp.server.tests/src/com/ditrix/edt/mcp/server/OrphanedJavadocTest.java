/**
 * Ratchet against ORPHANED javadoc: a {@code /** ... *}{@code /} block that documents
 * nothing, because a new member was inserted BETWEEN the block and the declaration it
 * was written for. The compiler cannot see it — javadoc is prose, and the inserted
 * member usually brought its own block — so the documentation silently detaches and the
 * member it belonged to is left undocumented.
 * <p>
 * Javadoc binds the comment that immediately precedes a declaration's FIRST token — its
 * first annotation or modifier. Measured, not assumed: {@code javadoc} was run on each
 * shape below and asked which text it rendered. Two blocks are therefore dropped:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>one whose next meaningful line is ANOTHER javadoc block — the later block is the
 *       nearer one, so the earlier documents nothing;</li>
 *   <li>one that sits AFTER an {@code @Deprecated}, between it and the member. Here it is
 *       the block BEFORE the annotation that survives, which is why reporting "the first
 *       of the pair" would name the wrong one. Only an annotation carries this rule: a
 *       modifier or a type name opens a head too, but it also opens a {@code static { }}
 *       or an {@code int f = expr}, which no javadoc can document.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>The fix is to MOVE the block back, not to delete it.</b> Across #341/#345/#353,
 * five of six such blocks were the ONLY documentation their method had — a mechanical
 * clean-up would have thrown the documentation away. Read the block, find the
 * declaration it describes (usually the one below the member that was inserted after
 * it), and put it there. Delete it only when the declaration it describes is gone, or
 * when a newer block on the same declaration supersedes it — and say so in the PR.
 * <p>
 * This does NOT fail the build — see {@link #FAIL_THE_BUILD} for the measurement behind
 * that decision, and {@link #KNOWN_LIMITS} for what it gets wrong in both directions. It
 * reports, and the report is worth having: it found four real orphans here in the week it
 * was written, each of them the only documentation its method had.
 * <p>
 * {@link #KNOWN_ORPHANS} is the allow-list a GATE would need, kept and tested so that
 * turning one on later is a one-line decision rather than a rewrite. It is empty.

     *       which case javadoc keeps the earlier and the LATER one is discarded; or</li>
     *   <li>it is still pending when a <code>}</code> closes a TYPE body — the member it was
     *       written for was deleted and left it behind.</li>

     * boundary inside a type body, and ANY code token that is not part of an annotation takes
     * it away.
     * <p>
     * That direction is the design. The gate used to ask the opposite question — is this one
     * of the places a declaration cannot be — and enumerate them: parentheses, then angle
     * brackets, then array dimensions, then the {@code extends}/{@code implements}/
     * {@code throws} clauses. Each was fixed and the next arrived, because that list is the
     * lexical grammar of Java and has no end. Proving the position instead makes an
     * unrecognised construct answer "not a declaration" by default, so a shape nobody has
     * written yet arrives as a miss.
     * <p>
     * Scanning rather than matching line prefixes is what keeps a text block holding Java
     * source, a {@code "://"} literal or a {@code /**} inside a string from being read as
     * documentation. It is still a scanner and not a lexer, and what that costs is listed
     * ONCE, in {@link #KNOWN_LIMITS}, which every report prints — so the reader holding the
     * report and the reader opening this file get the same list.
