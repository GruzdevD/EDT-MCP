/**
 * Tests the {@code disableIndices} half of the {@code rename_metadata_object} contract: WHICH change
 * points a requested index may switch off (#393), WHAT the executed report then claims about it (#394 -
 * the change points the request really left switched off, not the size of the request), and how the
 * entries that produced no skip at all are accounted for: an index that matched nothing or names a
 * required point (#394), while a token that can never be an index is refused before execution (#401).
 * <p>
 * Everything here is driven through {@code applyDisableIndices} - the method {@code performRename}
 * actually calls - rather than through the leaf walker underneath it. That is deliberate: the decision
 * under test lives in the branch that chooses whether to disable a leaf, so a test that poked the
 * walker directly would survive removing the guard entirely, and a guard whose removal no test notices
 * is not a guard. The reporting assertions likewise go through the real
 * {@code renderExecutedReport}, on the outcome the real walk produced.
 * <p>
 * Reached by REFLECTION: {@code applyDisableIndices} and {@code renderExecutedReport} are private, and
 * their only public entry ({@code rename}) needs a live EDT project, an {@code IMdRefactoringService}
 * and a BM transaction, none of which exist headlessly. The cost is stated rather than hidden -
 * RENAMING either method breaks these tests with a {@code NoSuchMethodException} instead of a compile
 * error.
 * <p>
 * The refactoring items are Mockito doubles because {@code isOptional()} is exactly the input under
 * test and no fixture reaches every combination of it: on {@code TestConfiguration} every NATIVE item
 * arrives optional, so the required-native case - the one #393 is about - has no live reproduction at
 * all and can only be exercised here. The change trees are bare LTK ({@link NullChange} /
 * {@link CompositeChange}), the same headless technique the numbering tests use.
