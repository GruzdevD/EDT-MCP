/**

 * {@link DeleteMetadataConsentSinglePointRatchetTest}.
 * <p>
 * A ratchet that reads bytecode has the same problem as any other check - its failure mode can look
 * exactly like its pass. Asserting that the real {@code DeleteMetadataTool} has no escape proves
 * nothing on its own, because a walk that reached nothing, or a mutation test that recognised
 * nothing, would say the same. Each class here is shaped like the real tool (an
 * {@code executeOnUiThread} entry, a {@code deleteWithConsent} gate, its own {@code DeleteWrite}
 * callback type) and then hides a write in ONE specific way. The ratchet runs its analysis against
 * them and must REPORT that way; {@link Gated} is the counterpart that must come back clean, so a
 * check that simply flagged everything would fail too.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here is ever instantiated or executed. The parameters exist only so the shapes compile.
