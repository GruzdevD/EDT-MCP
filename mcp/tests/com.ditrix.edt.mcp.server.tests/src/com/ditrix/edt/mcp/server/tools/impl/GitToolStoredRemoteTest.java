/**
 * Covers {@link GitTool#storedRemoteRefusal}: the pre-flight that REFUSES a command which would
 * print or use a remote whose STORED credential cannot be masked (issue #314). The command carries
 * no secret here - it sits in {@code remote.<name>.url} / {@code remote.<name>.pushurl}, where ASCII
 * whitespace - or a {@code ?} / {@code #} in front of the {@code @} - ends the output redaction's
 * scan before that {@code @}, so what precedes it could not be masked at all. A control character is
 * refused alongside them for a different reason: it ends none of those scans, but it can never be
 * legitimate in an authority and must not travel verbatim into the response.
 *
 * <p>The last section covers {@link GitTool#preflightRefusal}, the entry point {@code execute()}
 * actually calls: the predicate can be right and still be wired to nothing, so the refusal is also
 * driven through the shared seam and asserted in the shape the client receives it - a
 * {@code ToolResult.error(...)} result, not a bare string. That the seam runs before the consent
 * gate is pinned separately by {@code GitToolPreflightOrderRatchetTest}, which reads the compiled
 * {@code execute()} - the consent gate can ASK a human and so may not be called from a unit test.
 *
 * <p><b>Falsification.</b> Every case below fails on master by construction:
 * {@code storedRemoteRefusal} does not exist there, so this file does not even compile against it -
 * there is no version of this test that passes without the fix.
 *
 * <p><b>No process, no workspace.</b> Production reads the remotes from the JGit {@link Repository}
 * the call already holds, so these tests hold one too: real repositories are built in-process with
 * {@code Git.init()} (the way {@code GitRepositoryResolverTest} does it) and their configuration is
 * written through JGit. Nothing here runs {@code git}, touches the Eclipse workspace or mocks JGit.
 * The real-{@code git} parity - that git itself PERSISTS such a URL verbatim and JGit reads it back
 * unchanged - is proven by {@code GitToolProcessIntegrationTest}, which is skipped when git is
 * absent and therefore cannot be the only proof.
 *
 * <p><b>Positive control.</b> A poisoned URL is a valid fixture only if it survives the save/load
 * round-trip, so {@link #storeRemoteUrls} re-parses {@code .git/config} from disk with an
 * independent {@link Config} and asserts the offending character is still in place. Without that, a
 * character JGit escaped away or trimmed would make a green run mean nothing.
 *
 * <p>Assertions are made against OUR refusal text only - git's own wording and locale never enter
 * into it.

     * {@code .git} pointer it cannot use and keeps walking UP. A worktree placed inside the shared
     * repository's own tree would therefore quietly open the SHARED repository, and every assertion
     * about the linked one would be about the wrong object. The directory is created OUTSIDE it, and
     * the resolved git directory is asserted afterwards;</li>
     * <li>{@code build()} succeeding proves nothing on its own - {@code mustExist} is false by
     * default, so it happily returns a repository for a pointer to a directory that does not exist.
     * The check is on {@code getDirectory()}, not on the absence of an exception.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The returned repository is BARE as far as JGit is concerned - it derives a work tree from the
     * configuration it reads from the wrong place - which is exactly why the tool cannot open one of
     * these yet, and is beside the point for a check that never asks for a work tree.
