 * live backend for its workspace projects ({@code list_projects}, bounded by the SHORT
 * {@link #DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS} so one backend hung on a tool call cannot stall the
 * whole scan), and atomically swaps in a new immutable routing snapshot: the live backend
 * list, the project-to-backend owner map, and the duplicate-project map. Readers always see
 * a consistent snapshot; a failed or mid-flight refresh never exposes a half-built state.
 * <p>
 * {@link Backend} instances are cached per port across refreshes so their MCP sessions
 * survive periodic rescans (no re-handshake every cycle).
 * <p>

 * coalesce into a single scan without starving a legitimate sequential rescan.
