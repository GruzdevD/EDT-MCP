"""Variance check on the deciding metric: the two-phase confirm protocol.

Scored over every question flagged two_phase (the count comes from questions.json, never
a literal).

WHAT IS ACTUALLY COMMITTED, and it is not symmetric: each arm has its run from the main
sweep (r0), and only arm_a and arm_d additionally have rep_*_r9 - the blind re-run of the
destructive subset. So V2 and V3 rest on a single run each and their aggregate says
nothing about variance; V1 and V4 have two. The script prints what it finds and labels
the run count per arm - do not read a one-run line as a repeatability result. Add
answers/rep_<arm>_r<N>.json to widen it.
