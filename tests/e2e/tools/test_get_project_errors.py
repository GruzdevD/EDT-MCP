e2e tests for get_project_errors (kind: read).

The tool reads EDT's Configuration Problems (validation markers) for a project and
returns a Markdown report (response is the Markdown string -> Result.text; only the
error path goes through ToolResult.error(...).toJson() -> Result.structured.error).

Happy paths are made DETERMINISTIC despite the live marker state being out of our
control: a checkId filter that matches no check (and a NONE severity filter) forces
the documented "# No Errors Found" branch, which still echoes the project / severity /
objects filter banner. That branch text is produced ONLY when the tool actually ran
the marker stream and applied the filters, so a broken/no-op tool would fail it.

There are TWO object filters and they behave differently on purpose:
  * `objects`    - a loose case-insensitive SUBSTRING match over the reported location, with
                   every structural segment the filter knows normalized to both languages
                   (the XDTO member grammar is the documented exception - it is English-only
                   and is not a filter address at all). It makes NO existence claim: a
                   fragment and a typo are indistinguishable there, so it never emits
                   objectsNotFound.
  * `objectFqns` - EXACT model addresses, resolved with the same resolvers the write tools
                   use. This is the only input that reports back: the response is JSON with
                   `report` (the Markdown for a human) plus `objectsResolved` /
                   `objectsNotFound` / `objectsUnsupported`. "Exact" includes the KIND token
                   of a form member (a FIELD does not answer to a `Button.` address) - the
                   OWNER's kind in an item-level handler address included - and the
                   ё/е retry the write tools use (a name typed with ё resolves against the
                   stored е form).
                   SELECTION is coarser than ADDRESSING on purpose: EDT indexes a marker on
                   the object it belongs to, never on a member inside it (an attribute's
                   problem is reported on `Catalog.X`, a form item's on
                   `Catalog.X.Form.Y.Form`), so a resolved MEMBER address is scoped to that
                   owning node. Scoping it to the member alone would match nothing and answer
                   `objectsResolved` next to "# No Errors Found" - the false all-clear this
                   input exists to prevent.

Anything that must observe a REAL marker seeds it first (a syntax error written into a
fixture module with write_module_source, then a forced revalidation): the live marker set
is outside this file's control, so a test that merely hopes for one is a coin flip.
Such tests are kind="write-metadata", so the runner reverts the module on disk AND resyncs
the in-memory model afterwards.

Read tool => every non-seeding test also asserts assert_no_diff(): reading problems must
never mutate the project on disk. (The seeding tests dirty the module on purpose and are
cleaned up by the runner instead.)

Real error paths exercised by the negative matrix (read from GetProjectErrorsTool /
ProjectStateChecker):
  - non-existent projectName -> ProjectStateChecker.buildingErrorOrNull guards only the
    transient BUILDING state, so it falls through to "Project not found: <name>" (names the value)
  - out-of-set severity     -> "severity must be one of: ERRORS, BLOCKER, ..."
  - objects + objectFqns    -> refused (the two filters have different semantics)
