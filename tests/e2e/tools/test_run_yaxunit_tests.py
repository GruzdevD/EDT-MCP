e2e tests for run_yaxunit_tests (kind: read for our purposes — it must NOT modify
the git-tracked project tree).

What the tool does
------------------
RunYaxunitTestsTool starts a named BackgroundJobs job that launches a 1C runtime-client
with the RunUnitTests startup parameter and collects its JUnit XML. The start call waits
up to `timeout`: a short run returns the original Markdown report in r.text; otherwise
**Pending** carries a jobId that is polled with get_job_status. Repeating reconstructed
arguments is only a live duplicate guard and is not how a known run is addressed.
The report.md / junit.xml / xUnitParams.json files all live under the SYSTEM TEMP
dir (java.io.tmpdir/edt-mcp-yaxunit/...), NEVER inside the TestConfiguration/ git
tree — so a correct run leaves the fixture clean. Every test here ends with
assert_no_diff(); a YAXUnit tool that wrote into the project tree would be a bug.

ENVIRONMENT (this EDT / fixture) — why the SENTINEL is the realistic happy contract
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a runtime/debug tool. In THIS environment TestConfiguration has:
  - NO runtime-client launch configuration registered, and
  - NO running infobase / launched application.
Actually spawning a YAXUnit run is heavy and not configured (no infobase, no
YAXUnit extension), and the SKILL forbids starting one. So a well-formed call
(real project + a syntactic applicationId) cannot reach a real launch; it stops at
config resolution and returns a CLEAR, ACTIONABLE sentinel. THAT sentinel IS the
correct, realistic happy contract here, and we assert it precisely.

Control-flow facts pinned from RunYaxunitTestsTool.java (so the asserts are
mutation-sensitive against the SPECIFIC message, not just is_error):

  execute() — argument guards, fire FIRST, before any launch logic:
    * no launchConfigurationName AND no projectName
        -> "projectName is required (or pass launchConfigurationName)"
    * no launchConfigurationName AND projectName present but no applicationId
        -> "applicationId is required (or pass launchConfigurationName). Use
            get_applications or list_configurations."

  runTests() — only reached once the above guards pass:
    * updateScope naming an unknown extension (projectName call style,
      updateBeforeLaunch default true) -> validated FIRST, before launch-config
      resolution (LaunchLifecycleUtils.validateUpdateScope) — so it is reachable
      headlessly, with no launch config and no infobase:
        "updateScope requests unknown extension project name: <Name>. Available
         extension projects for this configuration: <names>. ..."
    * launchConfigurationName given but not found (resolveLaunchConfig -> null)
        -> "Launch configuration not found: '<name>'. Use list_configurations to
            see what's available."
    * projectName + applicationId given but NO matching runtime-client config
      (the TestConfiguration reality here) -> buildNoConfigError():
        "No launch configuration found for project '<proj>' and application
         '<app>'.\n\nCreate a launch configuration in EDT first (Run > Run
         Configurations > 1C:Enterprise Runtime Client)." (+ an optional table of
         any available configs). is_error=true.

  ORDERING NOTE (important for the negative matrix): in runTests() the launch
  config is resolved BEFORE ProjectStateChecker.checkReadyOrError and BEFORE the
  ProjectContext.exists()/isOpen() checks (those run at lines ~224-239, only after
  a config matches). So for a NON-EXISTENT project + applicationId with no config,
  the reachable error is the buildNoConfigError "No launch configuration found for
  project '<bad>' ..." branch — the bad project name IS echoed there, but the
  "Project not found" branch is shadowed and never reached for our no-config env.

Parameter shape (from getInputSchema / execute) — all OPTIONAL at the schema level;
the required-ness is conditional and enforced in code:
    launchConfigurationName (str), projectName (str), applicationId (str),
    extensions (array), modules (array), tests (array), tags (array) -- each declared
    type:array but a comma-separated string is also accepted (shared extractArrayArgument),
    timeout (int, default 45, clamped into [1, 45] — see below), updateBeforeLaunch
    (bool, default true).
There is NO closed enum and NO declared XOR pair; the real conditional-required
branches (projectName/applicationId vs launchConfigurationName) ARE exercised below.

TIMEOUT BOUNDS THE START CALL, AND IT IS CLAMPED (#357)
------------------------------------------------------
`timeout` bounds how long the start call waits for the job (whose work covers resolve +
pre-launch preparation + spawn + poll), and RunYaxunitTestsTool.clampTimeout() caps it at
MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 45. An MCP transport cuts a call at roughly 60s, so a larger
window could only turn the tool's answer into a bare transport error — which is
exactly what #357 reported. The clamp is SILENT: a large value is accepted and
quietly reduced, never rejected, so an existing caller passing `timeout: 240` keeps
working. That silence is asserted below, because "reject anything above 45" would be
a plausible-looking implementation that breaks every such caller.

Whenever the call has not finished the work it returns **Pending** with a `jobId`, the
`run_yaxunit_tests` owning-tool name, and progress naming the phase (`resolve` /
`prep:terminate` / `prep:check-changes` / `prep:recompute` / `prep:settle` /
`prep:db-update` / `spawn` / `run`). `prep:recompute` is CONDITIONAL - the change gate
publishes it only for a scope it could not certify as unchanged, and a certified one goes
`prep:check-changes` -> `prep:settle` instead (#310). The job continues
independently of this window and is polled by id, never by rebuilt arguments.

The named job declares a YAXUnit-specific destructive cancellation capability. A
cancel_job preview does nothing and warns that a confirmed live-run stop kills the
client, does not roll back the infobase, and can leave a partial/absent report. This
headless fixture cannot launch a client, so the actual termination path is proved by
the Java unit tests with a committed job and launch double rather than faked here.

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names): the project itself
(projectName "TestConfiguration"); CommonModule.Calc exists but is irrelevant here
(YAXUnit needs an infobase, not a module). No launch configuration registered.
