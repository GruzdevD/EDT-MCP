"""
e2e tests for update_database (kind: action) — DESTRUCTIVE infobase mutation.

update_database drives EDT's IApplicationManager.update(application, FULL|INCREMENTAL)
against the project's infobase (the database, NOT the project source files). It is a
JSON tool (getResponseType() == JSON): on success the data is in r.structured
(project/applicationId/updateType/stateBefore/stateAfter/message); on failure the
server sets isError and the message is in structured.error / r.text.

============================================================================
WHY THERE IS NO "REAL UPDATE" HAPPY PATH HERE (action-tool safety)
============================================================================
A genuinely-successful call performs appManager.update(...), which MUTATES the
infobase DB. The e2e contract forbids any happy mutation that could corrupt the
committed TestConfiguration fixture / its infobase, and a real update also needs a
live, non-exclusive infobase + a valid applicationId we cannot guarantee headlessly.
So we DELIBERATELY do not call the destructive update() success path.

Instead the "happy"/contract coverage exercises the tool's REAL resolution chain
end-to-end up to — but stopping short of — the destructive update(): a REAL, open
project (TestConfiguration) plus a non-existent applicationId. That call flows
through the full execute() pipeline (arg validation -> ProjectStateChecker ready
gate -> ProjectContext.exists()/isOpen() -> Activator IApplicationManager ->
appManager.getApplication(project, id)) and is rejected at getApplication() with
"Application not found: <id>. Use get_applications ..." BEFORE update() runs. This
is mutation-sensitive: a tool that no-op'd, succeeded blindly, or skipped resolution
would NOT produce this exact, project-resolved rejection — and it touches no DB and
no files. assert_no_diff() proves the fixture source is untouched.

update_database never writes TestConfiguration source FILES (it targets the infobase),
so EVERY call in this file — accepted-shape or rejected — must leave the project tree
clean: assert_no_diff() on all paths.

============================================================================
REAL error/sentinel paths in UpdateDatabaseTool.execute() (verified vs the Java)
============================================================================
Targeting is XOR-ish: pass launchConfigurationName (preferred) OR projectName+applicationId.
  - no launchConfigurationName & no projectName
        -> "projectName is required (or pass launchConfigurationName)"
  - no launchConfigurationName & projectName but no applicationId
        -> "applicationId is required (or pass launchConfigurationName). Use get_applications or list_configurations."
  - launchConfigurationName that does not exist
        -> "Launch configuration not found: '<name>'. Use list_configurations to see what's available."
  - projectName+applicationId, project does not exist
        -> the readiness pre-check (ProjectStateChecker.buildingErrorOrNull) refuses ONLY the
           transient BUILDING state and returns null for a missing project, so the call falls
           through to updateDatabase()'s own value-naming branch (the shared
           ProjectContext.notFoundMessage):
           -> "Project not found: <name>. Use list_projects to see available projects."
  - real open project + non-existent applicationId
        -> "Application not found: <id>. Use get_applications to get valid application IDs."
  - real open project + a SYNTHETIC launch identifier as applicationId (#379): list_configurations
    publishes "launch:<configName>" / "attach:<configName>" under its own `applicationId` key for a
    configuration whose application binding is absent or unreadable, and carrying that value here
    is the mistake the key invites. Still the application-not-found branch, but the message now DIAGNOSES the value
    instead of leaving the caller to re-read get_applications forever:
        -> launch: "... That value has the form of the identifier list_configurations reports for
           a launch configuration whose application binding is absent or unreadable, so it is not
           an application id. If '<name>' is a runtime-client configuration, pass it as
           launchConfigurationName instead. ..."
        -> attach: names the Attach (debug-server) configuration and says update_database requires
           a runtime-client one (advising launchConfigurationName there would only buy a second
           refusal — the Attach type is rejected).
    The wording says "has the form of" on purpose: the classification is made from the STRING, no
    configuration is looked up, so it must not assert that such a configuration exists.

NOT covered here (it needs a launch configuration whose ATTR_APPLICATION_ID is EMPTY, and no MCP
tool can create one — create_launch_config always writes a real id): the #379 fallback itself,
i.e. "config with no application binding -> the project's single application" and its ambiguity /
no-application / unreadable-attribute refusals. UpdateDatabaseToolTest covers those DECISIONS
against the package-private resolveLaunchConfigTarget / effectiveApplicationId /
resolveSoleApplicationId seams with a mocked ILaunchConfiguration; what stays uncovered anywhere
is only the launch-manager lookup and the two lines of execute() that join the seams.
