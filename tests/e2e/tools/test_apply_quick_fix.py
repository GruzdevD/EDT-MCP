e2e tests for apply_quick_fix.

Applies EDT's official quick-fix to one validation marker, addressed by the SAME
locator get_project_errors prints (Check code + optional Module path + Line) — EDT
markers carry no stable per-marker id. JSON-response tool: success lands in
Result.structured, errors in structured.error.

The happy path is DISCOVERY-based: it scans the extension project's detailed problems
for a row whose 'Fix registered' column says 'yes' (the doc-comment checks reliably
expose fixes), reads that row's Check code / Module path / Line, and applies it; a
locator that still matches several markers (or a multi-variant fix) is disambiguated with
index / variant. It then RE-SCANS get_project_errors and requires the marker COUNT for
that locator to have dropped - proving the fix actually changed something, not just
trusting the tool's self-reported success=true (a stub that always returned success
without doing anything would otherwise still pass). It then cleans up after itself
(revert + clean_project) so the run's tree stays clean. If the live fixture exposes no
auto-fixable marker the happy test SKIPS - a known, accepted tradeoff of discovery-based
scanning (there is no fixture-independent way to GUARANTEE a fixable marker without
seeding one, which this suite does not do here).

The table parsing itself is NOT discovery-dependent: it goes through the shared
escape-aware harness.split_markdown_row, whose contract is pinned deterministically by
test_markdown_table.py - so a parser regression fails there even when this test skips.

Negative matrix (real error paths from ApplyQuickFixTool):
  - unknown checkId           -> "No marker matches check '<id>' ... run get_project_errors"
  - missing required checkId  -> requireArguments rejects it, naming the parameter

    This is the invariant a stub cannot fake, and it is deliberately NOT tied to any
    particular fix working: a registered fix is not always an automated edit. EDT's
    doc-comment checks, for example, register OpenBslDocCommentViewFix (in
    com.e1c.v8codestyle.bsl.ui) - it OPENS the doc-comment view for a human and edits
    nothing, so headlessly it legitimately cannot apply. The tool must refuse those with a
    clear reason instead of reporting a success it did not achieve.

      - refused, with a reason naming why it could not be applied; or
      - applied, AND the marker count for that locator actually dropped.
    Anything else - success claimed with no effect - fails here.

    Mandatory, not skippable: it asserts over whatever fixable markers the fixture has, and
    only an EMPTY fixable set (nothing to assert about) skips.

    EVERY advertised candidate is checked, including the ones after one genuinely applies.
    Stopping at the first success would hide exactly the regression this test exists for -
